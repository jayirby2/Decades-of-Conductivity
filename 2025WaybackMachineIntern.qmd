# Narrative

Specific conductance measures water’s ability to conduct electricity,
which reflects the concentration of dissolved salts and inorganic ions. 
While terms like "conductivity" and 
"specific conductance" are often used interchangeably, the latter refers to 
conductivity normalized to a standard temperature of 25ºC and recorded in
micromhos per centimeter (µmhos/cm).
Specific conductance is an indirect measure of
dissolved solids such as chloride, sulfate, and calcium, which can vary by 
location and time.

Distilled water has a specific conductance of approximately 1-5 µmhos/cm, 
whereas seawater has a measure of around 40,000 µmhos/cm. Freshwater streams - 
the focus of this project - 
typically have a measure of approximately 100-1800 µmhos/cm. 

Increases in specific conductance indicate a rise of dissolved ions in the water. 
Although difficult to pinpoint, these dissolved ions are often linked to an 
increase/change in agriculture, urbanization, or other land uses. 

# Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to examine temporal trends of 
specific conductance levels in the Upper Manatee River. 
Similar studies have 
been conducted in surrounding watersheds, such as Horse Creek, a tributary
of the Peace River in Hardee County, FL.
Comparing trends between these watersheds may offer insight into broader 
regional patterns in water quality.

# The Watershed

The Duette Preserve is a Manatee county-owned park that was purchased from 
phosphate mining companies in 1984 and 1986. The purchase aimed to protect
the Lake Manatee reservoir and watershed, as well as preserve an important
ecosystem. 
Manatee River tributaries and creeks flow through the preserve and provide key 
assessments of the health of the watershed.

Row crop farms, pasturelands, and other agricultural operations
surround the Upper Manatee River watershed, and farming practices could
have changed over time, which could potentially have impacted conductivity 
levels in the watershed. 

# Methodology

## The Sampling Locations - OpenStreetMap

The crux of this project utilizes data collected from the UM4 - Upper Manatee 
River sampling site, slightly east of the reservoir.
East Fork and North Fork are 
tributaries of the Manatee River that flow through the Duette Preserve,
so they are important sites for assessing the 
quality of the watershed.
Horse Creek is the site of the nearby study, essential for comparing
similar trends.

All four of these sites are located on the map below. This OpenStreetMap is 
interactive, so the viewers unfamiliar with the region can zoom in/out to better
understand the sampling locations. Users can click on the markers to identify
sites.

                popup = "Upper Manatee River - UM4 Station") %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = -82.1187, lat = 27.5228, popup = "East Fork") %>%
  addMarkers(lng = -82.13, lat = 27.5745, popup = "North Fork") %>%
  addMarkers(lng = -81.984444, lat = 27.416389, popup = "Horse Creek")
```

## Data Exploration & Cleaning

The main time-series analysis utilized data from the Manatee County
UM4 sampling site.
East Fork and North Fork sampling locations are simply for performing a
historical comparative analysis of the Duette Preserve. 

This project utilizes water quality data from 1980 to 2024. 
Since 1995, Manatee County has recorded and stored their environmental
data in a database, so I appended the data post-1995 to a .csv. However, 
1995 is not a large enough time frame, especially since the Horse Creek 
study contained data well before that. For data before 1995, I had to 
think of alternative routes. 
Manatee County has a digital archive - or "Wayback Machine" - which
contains old documents, including historic water quality assessments.
There are hundreds of these documents, and some of them contained specific 
conductance data sampled from UM4. I manually sifted through hundreds of pages,
adding usable the data to the master .csv. 

I was able to obtain ~335 rows of specific conductance data collected from UM4.
I collected ~30 rows of data pre-1995. Although sparse and not ideal, it is the
best data available and still provides value. However, the water quality 
assessment documents only contained data from 1979-1985. 

I created a "Years" column to group samples by year, since I am showing the 
yearly trend of specific conductance. 
Assuming the data was collected correctly, I did not remove any outliers in 
terms of conductance. Sometimes, there were values that exceeded 1300 µmhos/cm,
and although much larger than most of the 
observations, these are still realistic measurements for freshwater.

The North and East Fork data was collected from the archived documents and also
only contain years from 1979-1985. 


## Modeling

Due to the absence of observed values between 1986 and 1994, 
I employed a modeling approach to estimate the mean specific 
conductance for those missing years.  
Given the time-series nature of the data and the presence of 
noisy observations, I chose a LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) 
model to interpolate a smooth trend across the entire time range.  
This model allowed me to estimate annual mean conductance values from 1986 to 
1994 based on surrounding data while preserving local patterns in the time 
series.

LOESS is useful here because it utilizes a certain number of nearby points when
calculating each local fitted value (eg., fitted values for every year). 
LOESS performs a weighted linear regression using k nearest neighbors, 
creating the weights based on the distance from the neighbor to the specific 
point. So, 
calculating the best predicted value for missing year 1990 would only use points
from years close to 1990, thus increasing accuracy for interpolation in time 
series data. 

To fine-tune the model, I used K-fold cross-validation to identify the optimal
span value, which controls the number, k, of neighboring data points used in each 
local fit. However, the cross-validation results varied across runs, yielding 
different span values each time. To address this, I repeated the tuning
process multiple times to observe convergence patterns, but the selected span 
remained inconsistent. Lower spans allowed the earlier years (before 1986) to
overly influence the interpolated region, since their weights are so large. 
Higher
spans just captured the overall trend, which I did not want.
Ultimately, I chose a span of 0.5, as it provided a good balance between the 
local trend of very small specific conductance levels and the broader trend of large 
increases in specific conductance levels. It also created a smooth fit that I felt
represented the whole data well. A span of 0.5 means that 50% of the
data points
are used for each weighted regression at each year.

umr_data <- umr_data %>%
  mutate(fitted_conductivity = predict(loess_model_sc, newdata = umr_data))

ggplot(umr_data, aes(x = Year, y = `Specific Conductivity`)) +
  geom_line(data = umr_data, aes(x = Year, y = fitted_conductivity), color='red',

                     labels = c("Digital Archive", 
                                "Current Database"),
                     name = "Data Source") +
  ggtitle("Figure 1: Specific Conductance at Upper Manatee River with LOESS Curve") + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Specific Conductance (µmhos/cm)") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'lightblue', color = 'black'))
```

# Results

To illustrate long-term trends, I calculated the mean specific conductance 
for each year and grouped the results into 5-year bins. Each bin represents 
the average specific conductance across its time span. 
For bins that include missing years, I used LOESS-predicted values 
to estimate those years’ contributions.

For the 1985–1989 bin, I combined the actual 1985 observation with LOESS-based 
estimates for 1986–1989 to produce the most accurate representation possible in 
the absence of real data. 

The interpolated bins are directly labeled in the figure below. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(intervals_tibble, aes(x = Year, y = Conductivity, fill = is_predicted)) +
  geom_col(color="black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Yes" = "orange", 
                               "No" = "lightblue"), 
                    name = "Interpolated*") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 600, by = 100)) +
  ggtitle("Figure 2: Five-Year Averages of Specific Conductance (1980–2025)") + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Specific Conductance (µmhos/cm)") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7.5)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Conductivity - SE, 
                    ymax = Conductivity + SE),
                width = 0.3)
```

For observed 5-year bins, standard error was calculated using the standard 
deviation of all raw conductivity values within the bin divided by the square 
root of the sample size, capturing natural variability in the data.
For interpolated bins, standard error was derived from the LOESS model’s 
prediction uncertainty, using the root mean square of the individual prediction
SEs divided by the square root of the number of interpolated years, representing
model-based estimation error.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bin_1980_mean <- intervals_tibble %>%
  filter(Year == "1980 - 1984") %>%
  pull(Conductivity) %>%
  mean()

bin_2010_mean <- intervals_tibble %>%
  filter(Year == "2010 - 2014") %>%
  pull(Conductivity) %>%
  mean()

bin_2020_mean <-intervals_tibble %>%
  filter(Year == "2020 - 2024") %>%
  pull(Conductivity) %>%
  mean()

most_increase <- ((bin_2010_mean - bin_1980_mean) / bin_1980_mean) * 100
total_increase <- ((bin_2020_mean - bin_1980_mean) / bin_1980_mean) * 100
```
The highest 5-year mean conductivity occurred between 2010 and 2014, 
representing a `r round(bin_2010_mean - bin_1980_mean, digits=3)` µmhos/cm, a
`r round(most_increase, digits = 3)`%  increase from the 1980–1984 level.

The total change from the first bin to the most recent (2020–2024) is 
`r round(bin_2020_mean - bin_1980_mean, digits=3)` µmhos/cm, a 
`r round(total_increase, digits = 2)`% increase.

# Discussion

The data provides strong evidence that specific conductance levels in the 
Upper Manatee River watershed have increased steadily over the past 40 years. 

The long-term trends 
observed in our study align closely with those reported in the
2007 Peace River Cumulative 
Impact Study, as shown below in Figure 3. This alignment reinforces the 
regional trajectory of rising conductivity levels.

**Figure 3: Specific Conductance at Horse Creek, Hardee County**

![Peace River Cumulative 
Impact Study – Horse Creek (Jan 2007)](PR.png)


## Is This Trend a Concern?

The Florida State Standard specifies that specific conductivity must not
exceed 1,275 µmhos/cm or increase more than 50% above background levels, 
whichever is greater. While our findings show that annual conductivity values
remain well below the 1,275 µmhos/cm threshold, long-term trends reveal 
increases of well over 50% compared to historic baselines. 

This raises an 
important question: do conductance values that remain within the absolute 
limit, yet have more than doubled over time, still represent a potential 
water quality concern?

There is no definitive answer to this question. Conductance levels have risen, 
but not to a degree currently known to harm plants or animals in the watershed. 
Additionally, the State's definition for "background levels" is ambiguous, 
so utilizing historic baselines may not produce an 
accurate threshold for 
categorizing harmful conductance levels.

All we know is that the observed trends
are clear and consistent across comparable watersheds. 

# Quality Assurance

## Data Integrity 

All raw data were checked for completeness, consistency, and validity prior to 
analysis. Outlier values (e.g., pH > 9) were 
flagged and reviewed based on known environmental thresholds and patterns in 
surrounding years. Missing values were explicitly handled using LOESS 
interpolation only when surrounding data supported stable local trends.

## Model Validation

The LOESS model was selected for its non-parametric flexibility and suitability
for environmental time-series data. Model parameters (e.g., span) were selected 
using a combination of K-fold cross-validation and visual inspection to balance 
model fit and smoothness.
Model fits were reviewed for smoothness and consistency 
with observed data on both sides of the interpolated gap (1986–1994).

## Reproducibility

All analyses were conducted using R and fully documented in Quarto notebooks. 
All code was written using the Tidyverse framework, following consistent data
manipulation and visualization practices for readability and reproducibility.
The scripts are version-controlled and can be re-run using the same data and 
settings to reproduce all tables, figures, and interpolations. 

## Cross-Validation with External Studies
Results were compared against similar studies from 
the Peace River Cumulative Impact Study (2007), particularly those from 
Horse Creek and Joshua Creek, to verify consistency of long-term trends 
across watersheds.
