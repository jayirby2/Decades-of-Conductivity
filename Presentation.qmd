## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

## Slide: Interactive Histogram

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
library(shiny)
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", 
            min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)

output <- plotOutput("hist_plot")
output$hist_plot <- renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$waiting, breaks = input$bins, col = "skyblue", border = "white")
})
```
