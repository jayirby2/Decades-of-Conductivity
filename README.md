# Manatee Wayback Machine | Decades of Conductivity

## _Manatee County Natural Resources Deparement, Environmental Protection Division; Intern Jay Irby_

## Project Overview

This project explores long-term trends in specific conductance levels in the Upper Manatee River, a 
key waterway in Manatee County, Florida. Specific conductance is a useful indicator of water quality, 
as it reflects the concentration of dissolved salts and minerals. By analyzing historical data from 
archived environmental reports and recent digital records, the project identifies how conductance levels 
have changed over time. To place these findings in a broader context, the analysis is compared to similar 
studies in nearby watersheds, such as Horse Creek in Hardee County. These comparisons help assess whether 
observed trends are isolated or part of larger regional patterns affecting water quality in Southwest Florida.

## How To Use This Project

This project is designed to help users explore changes in water quality over time through specific conductance data. 
All code is written in R using the Tidyverse package and coding principles, promoting reproducibility. Cleaning and modeling
files are both located in this repository.

In the 
project's website,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start by reviewing the Data section to understand the sources and how the data was cleaned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit the Model section to see how missing values were interpolated using LOESS smoothing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the Visualizations to observe trends over time and compare conductance levels across different 5-year periods.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Comparison section to view similarities between the Upper Manatee River and nearby watersheds like Horse Creek.

This project can serve as a template for similar environmental analyses using historical data and 
non-parametric modeling techniques. Modeling and cleaning are in seperate files, and further data manipulation, visualizations, etc. are in the main .Qmd file.

## About The Author

Hello, my name is Jay Irby, and I was currently interning with the Manatee County Environmental Protection Division when completing this project.
I am a data science major at the University of Florida, minoring in Geography and graduating in May 2026. I have a passion for 
data science and love applying it to areas like environmental applications, sports performance, 
and really any space where data can help tell a story or solve a problem. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to me
